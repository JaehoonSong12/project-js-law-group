If the other party committed harm due to negligence, recklessness, or intentional acts, then you might have a claim. When it was their actions - or their lack of actions - that was the direct cause of your pain, then they are potentially liable for the damage that you took. If your situation fits these criteria, then schedule a free consultation with us now to see what we can do for you.</p><h3>Our Process: Investigation to Resolution</h3><p>Though every case is personal and different, you can have broad expectations of various consultations, followed by dedicated investigation and collection of evidence. Once all records are obtained, then our attorneys will likely move to filing a claim and demand for compensation. If a settlement isn't reached by this point, then we may move to trial, where we will fight fiercely for your rights and the compensation you deserve.</p>"
